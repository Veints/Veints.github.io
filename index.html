        <p>Racero is a 1-2 player game. In the original game mode, you play as a block trying to dodge Purple squares, while aiming to collect the yellow square. As you continue to collect the yellow square, the arena gets smaller and smaller. Until it is so small you hit a Purple square.</p>
        <h2><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-racero-boost-edition/4557633918910464">Click to Play</a></h2>
        <p>Also, bet on the Red or blue square to gain Block currency. This currency will allow you to buy skins, new game modes, and revives in the game. This can be done in both links. But in this link you can unlock the previous list. While in the other link, you can only unlock skins.</p>
